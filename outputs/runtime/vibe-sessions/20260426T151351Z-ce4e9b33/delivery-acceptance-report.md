## Frozen Code Task TDD Evidence Requirements

- Record failing-first evidence for the changed behavior before implementation or defect correction.
- Record the green rerun that proves the targeted behavior passed after implementation.
- Map the changed behavior to targeted verification evidence; generic suite success alone is insufficient.
- If automated failing-first evidence is not appropriate, freeze and honor an explicit code-task TDD exception instead of silently skipping the requirement.

## Code Task TDD Evidence Coverage

- Missing code-task TDD evidence requirement: Record failing-first evidence for the changed behavior before implementation or defect correction.
- Missing code-task TDD evidence requirement: Record the green rerun that proves the targeted behavior passed after implementation.
- Missing code-task TDD evidence requirement: Map the changed behavior to targeted verification evidence; generic suite success alone is insufficient.
- Missing code-task TDD evidence requirement: If automated failing-first evidence is not appropriate, freeze and honor an explicit code-task TDD exception instead of silently skipping the requirement.

## Residual Risks

- 2 execution unit(s) failed.
- Required code-task TDD evidence remains unresolved.
