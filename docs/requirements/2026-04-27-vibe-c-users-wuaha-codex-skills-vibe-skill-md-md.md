## Goal

## Deliverable
Governed implementation artifacts, verification evidence, and cleanup receipts

## Constraints
- Do not bypass the fixed six-stage governed runtime.
- Do not widen scope silently beyond the frozen requirement document.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Requirement document is frozen before execution.
- Execution plan exists before implementation.
- Verification evidence exists before completion claims.
- Phase cleanup receipt is produced.

## Product Acceptance Criteria
- Requirement document is frozen before execution.
- Execution plan exists before implementation.
- Verification evidence exists before completion claims.
- Phase cleanup receipt is produced.
- The delivered output must satisfy observable behavior implied by the frozen goal and deliverable, not only internal runtime progress.
- Full completion wording is allowed only after downstream delivery truth is passing.

## Manual Spot Checks
- None required beyond automated verification for this task unless the execution scope expands to a user-visible or interactive flow.

## Completion Language Policy
- Full completion wording is allowed only when governance truth, engineering verification truth, workflow completion truth, and product acceptance truth are all passing.
- `completed_with_failures`, degraded execution, or pending manual actions must be reported as non-complete states.
- If manual spot checks remain pending, the run must be described as requiring manual review rather than fully ready.

## Delivery Truth Contract
- Governance truth: requirement, plan, execution, and cleanup artifacts remain traceable and authoritative.
- Engineering verification truth: targeted verification passes or fails explicitly; silence does not count as success.
- Workflow completion truth: planned units, delegated lanes, and specialist outputs reconcile back into the governed plan.
- Product acceptance truth: observable deliverable behavior satisfies frozen acceptance criteria before full completion language is allowed.

## Artifact Review Requirements
No additional artifact review requirements were frozen for this run.

## Code Task TDD Evidence Requirements
- Record failing-first evidence for the changed behavior before implementation or defect correction.
- Record the green rerun that proves the targeted behavior passed after implementation.
- Map the changed behavior to targeted verification evidence; generic suite success alone is insufficient.
- If automated failing-first evidence is not appropriate, freeze and honor an explicit code-task TDD exception instead of silently skipping the requirement.

## Code Task TDD Exceptions
No code-task TDD exceptions were frozen for this run.

## Baseline Document Quality Dimensions
No baseline document quality dimensions were frozen for this run.

## Baseline UI Quality Dimensions
No baseline UI quality dimensions were frozen for this run.

## Task-Specific Acceptance Extensions
No additional task-specific acceptance extensions were frozen for this run.

## Research Augmentation Sources
No research augmentation sources were frozen for this run.

## Primary Objective
[$vibe](C:\Users\wuaha\.codex\skills\vibe\SKILL.md) 阅读文档.md和里面的图片素材，整理需求

## Non-Objective Proxy Signals
- single sample pass only
- current test green only
- demo success only

## Validation Material Role
validation_only

## Anti-Proxy-Goal-Drift Tier
Tier C

## Intended Scope
scenario_specific

## Abstraction Layer Target
_author_to_declare_

## Completion State
partial

## Generalization Evidence Bundle
- cases: []
- note: add independent evidence before generalized completion claims

## Non-Goals
- Do not treat M/L/XL as user-facing entry branches.
- Do not introduce a second router or control plane.

## Autonomy Mode
interactive_governed

## Assumptions
- Interactive clarification is allowed if unresolved ambiguity materially changes implementation.

## Evidence Inputs
- Source task: [$vibe](C:\Users\wuaha\.codex\skills\vibe\SKILL.md) 阅读文档.md和里面的图片素材，整理需求
- Intent contract: intent-contract.json
- Runtime input packet: runtime-input-packet.json

## Runtime Input Truth
- Governance scope: root
- Root run id: 20260426T151351Z-ce4e9b33
- Entry intent: vibe
- Requested stop stage: phase_cleanup
- Requested grade floor: none
- Selected pack: orchestration-core
- Router-selected skill: vibe
- Runtime-selected skill: vibe
- Route mode: pack_overlay
- Route reason: candidate_signal_auto_route
- Confirm required: False

## Specialist Decision
- Governed `vibe` must explicitly record whether specialist execution is happening, stayed advisory, or remained unresolved before closeout.
- Decision state: approved_dispatch
- Resolution mode: approved_dispatch
- Notes: Bounded specialist recommendations were surfaced and auto-promoted into approved dispatch.

## Specialist Recommendations
These are mandatory bounded native specialist recommendations carried inside the governed `vibe` runtime. Eligible recommendations should auto-promote into bounded dispatch while `vibe` remains the only runtime authority.
If execution reaches non-empty effective `approved_dispatch`, governed `vibe` must emit one unified pre-execution disclosure that lists only actually executing Skills and each real `native_skill_entrypoint`.
